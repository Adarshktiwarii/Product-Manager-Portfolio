# Agent Log

Purpose: A durable, append-only activity log so any agent can resume work exactly where the last agent left off.

Usage rules:
- Append entries at the top under Today with ISO timestamps.
- Keep notes concise; link Issues/PRs/Commits for details.
- When handing off, ensure In Progress items reflect reality and include Next Actions.
